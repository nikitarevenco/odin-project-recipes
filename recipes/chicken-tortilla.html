    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My chicken tortilla soup is not a fast recipe, but it is one of the
      greatest chicken soup experiences known to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoky, spicy, slowly
      simmered tomato chicken broth is made from scratch, and the soup is topped
      with all your favorite garnishes: toasted tortilla strips, sour cream,
      avocado, cilantro, lime, and crumbled Mexican cheese.
