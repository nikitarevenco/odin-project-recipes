    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title.</p>
    <
    <p>
      It takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who
      do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon
      grease and continue with the recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended
      for people counting calories.)
    </p>
